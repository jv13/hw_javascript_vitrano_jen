#Javascript Homework

[My GitHub repo link](https://github.com/jv13/hw_javascript_vitrano_jen.git)

##Sources

* I used [W3 Schools](http://www.w3schools.com/json/json_syntax.asp) to help me with the presidents branch array.  Through using this link I was able to see that I needed to switch all of the keys in the objects to strings in order to get the result of Bill Clinton.

##Comments
* This assignment was challenging, but I was excited when the console created an output I was looking for.  Originally, I was stuck on the presidents branch array.  I had to walk away and revisit the next day and that is when I was able to to output 'Bill Clinton'.  
* I do not believe my inception function is correct, although I know it logs out the correct output.  I continually received the error "callback is not a function".  I tried to re-watch lectures and Lynda.com videos but I just could not figure it out.
* When I went to push the branches to the repo, I had pushed the master branch first, when I went to push the rest of them I kept receiving "Branch master set up to track remote branch master from origin. Everything up-to-date".  Therefore in the repo it only shows my master branch not sure if I should have pushed them after I coded each branch? I did consistently switch between each branch when I coded the assignment.
* I also added comments to the JavaScript so I understood where the different branches began.
